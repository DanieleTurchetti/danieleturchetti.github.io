Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique that produces a smaller set of uncorrelated variables from a larger set of correlated variables.
This allows to visualize, explore, and discover hidden features of the data set.
It is also very useful to perform a special type of multilinear regression (see Principal Components Regression).
Here we explore how to perform PCA using R, how to read and visualize the output, as well as good practices and how to avoid pitfalls.
For a more theoretical viewpoint on PCA, you are referred to the lecture notes.

In **R**, PCA is performed using either *princomp()* or *prcomp()* (the latter being the preferred method).
